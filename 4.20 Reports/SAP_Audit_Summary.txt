- User FF_PTP in session S0011 (2025-03-28) using RMPS_SET_SUBSTITUTE

### 2. Direct table manipulation via SE16
**Count:** 23 occurrences
**Recommendation:** Verify business justification for direct table access

**Key Examples:**
- User FF_PTP in session S0005 (2025-03-10) using SE16
- User FF_PTP in session S0011 (2025-03-28) using SE16
- User FF_PTP in session S0020 (2025-04-10) using SE16

### 3. Changes with potentially missing audit trail
**Count:** 19 occurrences
**Recommendation:** Verify if actual data changes occurred and why they weren't properly logged

**Key Examples:**
- User FF_PTP in session S0005 (2025-03-10) using SE16
- User FF_PTP in session S0011 (2025-03-28) using SE16
- User FF_PTP in session S0020 (2025-04-10) using SE16

### 4. Debugging tools used in conjunction with data changes
**Count:** 19 occurrences
**Recommendation:** Review the specific changes made during debugging to verify legitimacy

**Key Examples:**
- User FF_PTP in session S0005 (2025-03-10) using SE16
- User FF_PTP in session S0011 (2025-03-28) using SE16
