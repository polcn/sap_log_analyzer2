# SAP Log Analyzer Report Guide

## Introduction

The SAP Log Analyzer is a comprehensive security auditing tool designed to aggregate, analyze, and assess risks in SAP system logs. It processes multiple data sources to create a unified timeline of user activities, highlighting potential security risks and providing context through SysAid ticket integration.

### Purpose

- Automate the processing of SAP security logs and change documents
- Create a comprehensive timeline of user activities
- Identify potential security risks and suspicious patterns
- Link SAP activities to business context through SysAid tickets
- Generate detailed reports for security auditing and compliance purposes

### Report Outputs

The SAP Log Analyzer produces several output files:

1. **SAP_Audit_Report.xlsx** - The main output with multiple sheets containing detailed analysis
2. **SAP_Audit_Summary.txt** - A text summary of key findings
3. **SAP_Audit_Analysis.html** - An HTML report with interactive visualizations
4. **SAP_Audit_Metadata.json** - Technical metadata about the analysis run

## Data Sources Explained

The SAP Log Analyzer integrates data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive view of system activities:

### SM20 Security Audit Logs

**Purpose**: Record security-relevant events and user activities in the SAP system.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Captures user logins, transaction executions, table access, and authorization checks
- Contains event codes that indicate the type of activity (AU1, AU3, BU4, etc.)
- Includes timestamps, users, transaction codes, and activity descriptions
- Often the primary source for detecting suspicious activities

**Limitations**:
- May not capture all changes to data
- Limited detail about what specifically was changed
- Can have high volume of routine activities that obscure important events

### CDHDR (Change Document Headers)

**Purpose**: Track metadata about changes to business objects.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Records who made changes and when
- Identifies which business objects were modified
- Contains change document numbers that link to detailed change records
- Provides transaction codes used to make changes

**Limitations**:
- Only tracks changes to objects with change logging enabled
- Does not contain the actual changed values (these are in CDPOS)

### CDPOS (Change Document Items)

**Purpose**: Store detailed information about specific field-level changes.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Contains the actual before and after values for changed fields
- Links to CDHDR via change document numbers
- Identifies tables and fields that were modified
- Contains change indicators (U=Update, I=Insert, D=Delete)

**Limitations**:
- Technical in nature, often requires business context to interpret
- Field names may be cryptic and require SAP data dictionary knowledge

### SysAid Tickets

**Purpose**: Provide business context for system changes.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Contains helpdesk ticket information related to system changes
- Includes ticket numbers, descriptions, requesting users, and timestamps
- Helps explain why changes were made
- Connects technical activities to business requirements

**Limitations**:
- Not all SAP activities may have associated tickets
- Ticket descriptions may be vague or incomplete

## Report Structure

The main output file, **SAP_Audit_Report.xlsx**, contains multiple sheets:

### Session Timeline Sheet

## Understanding Risk Assessments

The SAP Log Analyzer uses a multi-factor approach to assess risks:

### Risk Levels

- **Critical (Red)**: 
  - Activities that strongly indicate potential malicious behavior
  - Examples: Use of debugging in sensitive transactions followed by data changes, backdoor activities
  - Immediate investigation recommended

- **High (Orange)**:
  - Suspicious activities that warrant closer examination
  - Examples: Direct table modifications, changes without proper audit trail
  - Investigation within 24-48 hours recommended

- **Medium (Yellow)**:
  - Unusual or sensitive activities that may need attention
  - Examples: Mass changes, security configuration modifications
  - Review as part of regular audit processes

- **Low (Green)**:
  - Normal system activities with minimal security concerns
  - Examples: Standard reporting, display transactions
  - No specific action required

### Risk Assessment Factors

The tool considers multiple factors when assessing risk:

1. **Activity Type**:
   - Direct table access (SE16, SE16N)
   - Debugging transactions (SE30, STMS)
   - System configuration changes
   
2. **Data Sensitivity**:
   - Changes to sensitive tables (financial, HR, security)
   - Modifications to critical configuration
   - Access to personally identifiable information

3. **Behavior Patterns**:
   - Unusual timing (after hours, weekends)
   - Rapidly executed changes
   - Deviation from user's normal patterns

4. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - Display activities followed by unexplained changes
   - Debugging followed by sensitive data modifications
   - Authorization bypass attempts

## SysAid Integration

The SysAid integration connects SAP activities to helpdesk tickets, providing business context for changes.

### Ticket Mapping

Activities are linked to SysAid tickets based on:
- Direct ticket references in the SAP logs
- Temporal proximity of tickets to activities
- User correlation between ticket requesters and SAP users

### SysAid Columns

The following ticket information is included in the reports:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| SYSAID # | Ticket number |
| Title | Brief description of the issue/request |
| Description | Detailed explanation of the ticket |
| Notes | Additional information added to the ticket |
| Request user | Person who requested the change |
| Process manager | Person responsible for implementing the change |
| Request time | When the ticket was created |

### Interpretation

- Activities with associated tickets generally pose lower risk as they have documented business justification
- Discrepancies between ticket details and actual changes may indicate issues
- High-risk activities without tickets require additional scrutiny
- Tickets can help identify appropriate personnel for follow-up questions

## Common Use Cases
