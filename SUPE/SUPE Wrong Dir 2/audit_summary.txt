## Conclusion

The analysis has detected significant security concerns including:
- 177 high or critical risk events
- 19 potential stealth changes (activities with change permission but no change records)

Recommended Actions:
1. Review all high-risk events, especially those involving debugging and data changes
2. Investigate potential stealth changes to confirm if unlogged changes occurred

With the new date-based session approach, the system has identified patterns spanning longer time periods than previously detected with the 60-minute window approach.
